# Imouto

Imouto is a collection of automation scripts for installing an instance of [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/) using [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home).

## Requirements

Here are the basic requirements of the machine youâ€™re using imouto from.

* GNU/Linux or MacOS
* Git
* Ansible 2.4 or later (also available on pip: `pip install ansible`)

## Use cases

Imouto can be used in different ways to install Tatoeba depending on your setup and needs. Whatever the way, you first need to:

- Install the basic requirements above
- Install the requirements for your use-case below
- Clone the repository and go to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tatoeba/imouto
cd imouto
```

From there, you may install Tatoeba:

- [On a local VM](#install-tatoeba-on-a-local-vm)
- [On a local machine](#install-tatoeba-on-a-local-machine)
- [On a remote machine](#install-tatoeba-on-a-remote-machine)

### Install Tatoeba on a local VM

This is the preferred way for developers to setup a local development environment. The additional requirements are:

* VirtualBox 4.0 or later, which can be installed with a package manager or with the help of [generic binaries](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
* Vagrant 1.7 or later

#### Usage Instructions

- Configure proxy on Vagrant VM if you are behind proxy server:
  - Install proxyconf plugin:

```bash
 vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
```

  - And then add the following to Vagrantfile:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-proxyconf")
    config.proxy.http     = "http://username:password@proxy_host:proxy_port"
    config.proxy.https    = "http://username:password@proxy_host:proxy_port"
    config.proxy.no_proxy = "localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com"
  end
end
```

- Run this command to install everything. Please be patient, it takes a while for vagrant to download the ~300MB box on your machine and then to provision it using ansible.

```bash
vagrant up
```

- Once it completed, you should be able to:
  - Access your local instance of Tatoeba at http://localhost:8080/
  - Run `vagrant ssh` to ssh to the machine.
  - Use the script `mount.sh` (run it to get usage instructions) to mount any of the VM's directory on your host machine in order to modify files without ssh-ing to the VM. (Use 'vagrant' as the password if prompted after running `mount.sh`: `vagrant@127.0.0.1's password:`)

#### Post-provisioning tasks

You may want to perform certain tasks independently without having to re-provision the whole machine again. To do that you can use the following command:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i ../.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -u vagrant -U root playbook-name.yml
```

where `playbook-name.yml` is the name of the playbook that you want to run on the VM. Since the command is too long and very difficult to remember, you can use the following commands to create an alias:

```bash
echo "alias imouto-devel='ansible-playbook -i ../.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -u vagrant -U root'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can simply use the following command to run a playbook (inside the `ansible` directory):

```bash
imouto-devel playbook-name.yml
```

The following playbooks are included with imouto currently:

- `local.yml`: To provision the whole machine (development) by calling each of the roles. Note that this can also be achieved by running `vagrant provision` command in the `imouto` directory.
- `setup_lemp.yml`: To install and set up nginx, mysql and php5-fpm.
- `update_code.yml`: To fetch the latest code from Tatoeba's github repository and update it on VM.
- `setup_database.yml`: To re-initialize the whole Tatoeba database.
- `setup_external_tools.yml`: To install and set up the external tools used by the website including manticore.
- `configure_manticore.yml`: To configure manticore search, create indexes and start the search daemon.
- `setup_newrelic.yml`: To install and setup New Relic monitoring daemons.

### Install Tatoeba on a local machine

This setup is for using Tatoeba on a dedicated machine. Please be aware that this will install many things all over the place and may mess up with existing applications like nginx, mysql etc. The additional requirements are:

* Debian Stretch
* sudo

Note that Debian Stretch only packages Ansible 2.2 whereas we need 2.4. You can follow [these instructions](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-debian) to get Ansible 2.4 on your Debian Stretch machine.

#### Usage Instructions

- Move to the ansible directory

```sh
cd ansible
```

- Edit the file `host_vars/default` to set some variables according to your needs, such as:

```
code_dir: /home/johndoe/tatoeba/
git_rep: https://github.com/myfork/tatoeba2
```

- Install everything

```sh
ansible-playbook ./local.yml
```

### Install Tatoeba on a remote machine
