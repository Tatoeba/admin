# Imouto

Imouto is a collection of automation scripts for installing an instance of [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/) using [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home).

## Requirements

Here are the basic requirements of the machine youâ€™re using imouto from.

* GNU/Linux
* Git
* Ansible 1.4 or later (also available on pip: `pip install ansible`)

## Use cases

Imouto can be used in different ways to install Tatoeba depending on your setup and needs.

### Install Tatoeba on a local VM

This is the preferred way for developers to setup a local development environment. The additional requirements are:

* VirtualBox 4.0 or later, which can be installed with a package manager or with the help of [generic binaries](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
* Vagrant 1.7 or later

#### Usage Instructions

- Install the requirements above
- Clone the github repo on your machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Tatoeba/imouto
```

- Use vagrant to first download the box and then provision it using ansible. Please be patient, it takes a while for vagrant to download the ~300MB box on your machine and then to provision it using ansible.

```bash
$ cd imouto #ignore if already in the imouto directory
```

- Configure proxy on Vagrant VM if you are behind proxy server:
  - Install proxyconf plugin:

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
```

  - And then add the following to Vagrantfile:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-proxyconf")
    config.proxy.http     = "http://username:password@proxy_host:proxy_port"
    config.proxy.https    = "http://username:password@proxy_host:proxy_port"
    config.proxy.no_proxy = "localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com"
  end
end
```

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

- Once it completed, you should be able to:
  - Access your local instance of Tatoeba at http://localhost:8080/
  - Run `vagrant ssh` to ssh to the machine.
  - Use the script `mount.sh` (run it to get usage instructions) to mount any of the VM's directory on your host machine in order to modify files without ssh-ing to the VM. (Use 'vagrant' as the password if prompted after running `mount.sh`: `vagrant@127.0.0.1's password:`)

#### Post-provisioning tasks

You may want to perform certain tasks independently without having to re-provision the whole machine again. To do that you can use the following command:

```bash
$ cd ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i ../.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -u vagrant -U root playbook-name.yml
```

where `playbook-name.yml` is the name of the playbook that you want to run on the VM. Since the command is too long and very difficult to remember, you can use the following commands to create an alias:

```bash
$ echo "alias imouto-devel='ansible-playbook -i ../.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -u vagrant -U root'" >> ~/.bashrc 
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can simply use the following command to run a playbook (inside the `ansible` directory):

```bash
$ imouto-devel playbook-name.yml
```

The following playbooks are included with imouto currently:

- `local.yml`: To provision the whole machine (development) by calling each of the roles. Note that this can also be achieved by running `vagrant provision` command in the `imouto` directory.
- `setup_lemp.yml`: To install and set up nginx, mysql and php5-fpm.
- `update_code.yml`: To fetch the latest code from Tatoeba's github repository and update it on VM.
- `setup_database.yml`: To re-initialize the whole Tatoeba database.
- `setup_external_tools.yml`: To install and set up the external tools used by the website including sphinx and imagick.
- `configure_sphinx.yml`: To configure sphinx search, create indexes and start the search daemon.
- `setup_newrelic.yml`: To install and setup New Relic monitoring daemons.
